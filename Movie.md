# Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness

Welcome to the most brutally honest review of the **Doctor Strange**
**and the Multiverse of Madness** movie!!! 

While the movie was really good in terms of casting, editing,
plot, and all that other really important movie stuff, I wouldn't
consider it a good movie because it didn't have enough of the entire 
reason everyone went to the movies to see the dang movie in the first
place: *THE SCARLET WITCH*

Here's some Java code that prints the movie's title and year released:

<pre>
public class PrintMovieInformation { 
    public static void main (String [] args) { 
        System.out.println("Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness - 2022"); 
    } 
}
